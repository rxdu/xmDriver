# Two targets since 0.5.0 (ADR 0007 target split):
#   - xmotion::xmBase          — the Eigen-FREE core (needs Threads only)
#   - xmotion::xmBaseGeometry  — the Eigen geometry tier (needs Eigen3)

# always do; a core-only build with -DXMBASE_GEOMETRY=OFF does not).

# Eigen3 belongs to the OPTIONAL geometry target only. Both targets live in
# ONE export set (no COMPONENTS bookkeeping needed to link either), so Eigen3
# is looked up QUIETLY: core-only consumers configure with zero Eigen on the
# system. A consumer that links xmotion::xmBaseGeometry either has Eigen3
# discoverable (this quiet find resolves it) or should request
#   find_package(xmBase REQUIRED COMPONENTS geometry)
# to turn a missing Eigen3 (or a core-only install) into a clear
# configure-time diagnostic instead of a generate-time one.
